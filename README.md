# Employee Salary Calculator

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Description

This web app stores the following employee information: 

- First name
- Last name
- ID number
- Job title
- Annual Salary

All of this information is displayed on the DOM. The total monthly cost for all stored employees is also displayed on the DOM. 

Stored employees can be removed. Once an employee is removed, their info is deleted from the record and the DOM is appropriately updated. Additionally, the total monthly salary is updated on the DOM to refelct the removal. 

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
